This is a restoration of the earliest version of Infinite Yield FilteringDisabled. This is not IY FE.

Most of the commands may work, but will not be replicated onto the server. What I mean is that you'll be the only one who'll see stuff, others wouldn't.

[Original](https://web.archive.org/web/0id_/https://pastebin.com/raw/MjBzRjmT) has a lot of errors, but this restored versions has them all fixed by me.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("http://github.com/IvanTheProtogen/infiniteyieldFD/raw/main/main.lua",true))();
```
